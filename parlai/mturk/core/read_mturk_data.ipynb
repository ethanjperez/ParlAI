Nothing can spoil our adventure. Those weather reports are never right. Sara: And it said there was a chance of high winds. Paul: Ah. Don't worry. Sara: [thunder] Paul. Paul. Did you remember to bring our raincoats just in case, like I told you? [light rain] Paul: Uh ... no. I left them on the front porch. [heavy rain] Sara: What are we going to do now? Paul: We'll have to sleep in the car! Hurry get in! [door shut] Sara: So, Paul, what are we going to do now? Paul: How about playing a card game? Sara: Uhh. I left them next to the picnic table. [Hmmm] Hey, you don't want me to go out in this rain and get them, do you? Paul: No. That's okay. So what now? Sara: Well, we could head down the mountain and stay at that hotel we passed on the way up, or go home. Paul: Hmm, why don't we just make the best of it here and hope the weather clears.
