Amy believed in herself and she thought she could realize her dream.\n\nAfter every public recital, she would ask her dad about her performance. \"You still have a long way to go\" was the answer she used to get in return.

Just to give you an idea, the quotes were from this passage:

The Last Supper is regarded as one of the supreme masterpieces in the whole field of pictorial art. Tradition has it that Leonardo Da Vinci worked for ten years upon the painting, the monks in the church annoyed at the delay. It was said that Leonardo often painted continuously from dawn to night without eating his meals. But at other times he spent hours before the picture, lost in contemplation, examining, comparing, and measuring his figures.\n\nThis inactivity aroused the anger of the fussy Prior, the head of the church, who belonged to the large group of those who believed that the busier a man seems, the more he accomplishes; and so he tried to find fault with the idle  painter. Leonardo was slightly unhappy and explained to somebody else that there is a great difference between the work of the creative artist and the stonemason . The creative artist needs time for contemplation; he may be busiest when his hands are idlest. Just now he needed two heads to complete the picture: that of Christ, for which no model on earth could be found, for where was the man to be found whose face would express the strength, and beauty, and tenderness, and deep sorrow of the Christ; then he also needed a head of Judas, and that was hard to find as well, for where was the man whose face could express the meanness of that base traitor . But he would look no further; if none came his way, he would be satisfied to take Prior as a model for Judas. This threat silenced the angry Prior, who quite naturally had no desire to pass to descendants in such a fashion.

The first quoted sentence most directly answers the question, and it supports answer D.

Just to give you an idea, the quotes were from this passage:

The Last Supper is regarded as one of the supreme masterpieces in the whole field of pictorial art. Tradition has it that Leonardo Da Vinci worked for ten years upon the painting, the monks in the church annoyed at the delay. It was said that Leonardo often painted continuously from dawn to night without eating his meals. But at other times he spent hours before the picture, lost in contemplation, examining, comparing, and measuring his figures.\n\nThis inactivity aroused the anger of the fussy Prior, the head of the church, who belonged to the large group of those who believed that the busier a man seems, the more he accomplishes; and so he tried to find fault with the idle  painter. Leonardo was slightly unhappy and explained to somebody else that there is a great difference between the work of the creative artist and the stonemason . The creative artist needs time for contemplation; he may be busiest when his hands are idlest. Just now he needed two heads to complete the picture: that of Christ, for which no model on earth could be found, for where was the man to be found whose face would express the strength, and beauty, and tenderness, and deep sorrow of the Christ; then he also needed a head of Judas, and that was hard to find as well, for where was the man whose face could express the meanness of that base traitor . But he would look no further; if none came his way, he would be satisfied to take Prior as a model for Judas. This threat silenced the angry Prior, who quite naturally had no desire to pass to descendants in such a fashion.

Amy Smith, a famous dancer from the U.S., had to have her right leg cut after a car accident. She was also cut off on her career road.\nThough the accident brought her bright career to a stop, she didn't give up. In the painful months that followed, Amy met a doctor who developed a man-made leg for her. So strongly, she wanted to go back to dancing. Amy believed in herself and she thought she could realize her dream.\n\nAfter every public recital, she would ask her dad about her performance. \"You still have a long way to go\" was the answer she used to get in return. In January 1984, Amy made a historic comeback by giving a public recital in Los Angeles. She performed in such a great manner that it moved everyone to tears. That evening when she asked her dad the usual question, he didn't say anything. He just touched her feet as a praise. Amy's comeback was so moving that a film producer decided to make the story into a hit film.\n\nWhen someone asked Amy how she had managed to dance again, she said quite simply, \"You don't need feet to dance!\"  Nothing is impossible in this world. If you have the will to win, you can achieve anything.
